## 1. BACKGROUND

### 1.1 Rationale 
Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic cognitive vulnerability linked to anxiety disorders, depression, and impaired decision-making under ambiguity. Traditional interventions (CBT, mindfulness) address IU indirectly. Safe Aperture proposes a direct, graduated exposure approach specifically targeting ambiguity tolerance.

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework
Safe Aperture is based on:
- **Exposure therapy principles:** Graduated, repeated exposure to ambiguous stimuli reduces anxiety response
- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy:** Training observation without interpretation
- **Mindfulness:** Present-moment awareness without judgment

### 1.3 Innovation
Unlike general mindfulness, Safe Aperture:
- Targets ambiguity specifically (not just attention)
- Uses structured progression (Levels 1-3)
- Includes safety protocols (Emergency Exit)
- Balances challenge with support

---

## 2. OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Primary Objective
Test whether 4-week Safe Aperture training increases ambiguity tolerance (measured by TAS) compared to waitlist control.

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives
- Assess intervention acceptability (completion rate, satisfaction)
- Explore effects on intolerance of uncertainty (IUS-12)
- Explore effects on general anxiety (GAD-7)
- Identify predictors of response (baseline anxiety, meditation experience)

---

## 3. HYPOTHESES

**H1 (Primary):** Intervention group will show greater increase in TAS scores from baseline to Week 4 compared to control group.

**H2:** Effect will persist at Week 8 follow-up (though possibly attenuated).

**H3:** Intervention effects on IUS-12 and GAD-7 will parallel TAS changes.

**H4 (Exploratory):** Participants with moderate baseline anxiety will benefit most; those with high anxiety may show smaller gains.

---

## 4. DESIGN

### 4.1 Study Type
Randomized controlled pilot study

### 4.2 Groups
- **Intervention (n=15):** Safe Aperture training (Levels 1-3)
- **Waitlist Control (n=15):** No intervention during study period; offered training after completion

### 4.3 Randomization
Simple randomization (1:1) using random number generator after baseline assessment.

### 4.4 Blinding
- Participants: Not blinded (impossible with behavioral intervention)
- Assessors: Automated (Qualtrics), thus blinding not applicable
- Analysts: Blinded to group assignment during preliminary analysis

## 6. INTERVENTION

### 6.1 Safe Aperture Structure

**Level 1 (Weeks 1-2): Everyday Ambiguity**
- Duration: 10 minutes/day
- Content: Observing mundane ambiguous situations (delayed text response, unclear instructions) without seeking resolution
- Example exercise: "Notice an ambiguous moment today. Describe it without explaining it."

**Level 2 (Week 3): Interpersonal Ambiguity**
- Duration: 15 minutes/day
- Content: Tolerating unclear social signals or intentions
- Example: "Recall a time someone's behavior confused you. Sit with that confusion without assigning meaning."

**Level 3 (Week 4): Conceptual Ambiguity**
- Duration: 20 minutes/day
- Content: Engaging with abstract, unresolvable questions
- Example: "Contemplate: 'What is the purpose of uncertainty?' Resist answering."

### 6.2 Delivery
- Web-based platform: https://riteofrenaissance.github.io/safe_aperture_simulation.html
- Participants log in daily, complete exercise, submit brief reflection
- Automated email reminders

### 6.3 Safety Features
- **Emergency Exit button:** Allows immediate cessation if distress becomes overwhelming
- **Weekly check-ins:** RA contacts participants to assess wellbeing
- **Distress protocol:** If GAD-7 ≥15 or participant reports severe distress, RA refers to campus counseling

### 6.4 Adherence Monitoring
Tracked via platform analytics:
- Logins per week
- Exercise completions
- Time spent per session

---

## 7. MEASURES

### 7.1 Primary Outcome
**Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (TAS) - McLain (2009)**
- 13 items, 5-point Likert
- Higher scores = greater tolerance
- Administered: Baseline, Week 4, Week 8

### 7.2 Secondary Outcomes
**Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale - Short Form (IUS-12)**
- 12 items, 5-point Likert
- Higher scores = greater intolerance
- Timepoints: Baseline, Week 4, Week 8

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)**
- 7 items, 4-point scale
- Range 0-21; ≥10 = moderate anxiety
- Timepoints: Baseline, Week 4, Week 8

### 7.3 Process Measures
- **Adherence:** % of exercises completed
- **Satisfaction:** 5-item post-intervention questionnaire
- **Adverse events:** Open-ended weekly check-in

### 7.4 Baseline Predictors
- Demographics (age, gender, education)
- Meditation experience
- Current therapy status

---

## 8. PROCEDURES

### 8.1 Timeline

**Week 0:** Recruitment & screening
- Interested individuals complete online screener
- Eligible participants sent consent form
- Upon consent, complete baseline assessments

**Week 1:** Randomization & intervention start
- Participants randomized
- Intervention group receives login credentials
- Control group informed of waitlist status

**Weeks 1-4:** Active intervention period
- Intervention group: Daily exercises
- Both groups: Weekly check-in emails from RA
- Both groups: Week 4 assessments

**Weeks 5-8:** Follow-up
- No active intervention
- Week 8 assessments for both groups

**Week 9:** Debrief
- Control group offered intervention
- Intervention group debriefed on experience

### 8.2 Data Collection
All data collected via Qualtrics (or similar HIPAA-compliant platform accessed through university).

---

## 9. ANALYSIS PLAN

### 9.1 Sample Size Justification
This is a pilot/feasibility study. N=30 provides 80% power to detect large effect (d=0.8) with α=0.05. Given resource constraints, this is deemed acceptable for preliminary data.

### 9.2 Primary Analysis
**Independent samples t-test** comparing change scores (Week 4 - Baseline) on TAS between groups.

**Effect size:** Cohen's d with 95% CI

**Significance level:** α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

### 9.3 Secondary Analyses
- Repeated measures ANOVA (Group × Time) for TAS, IUS-12, GAD-7
- Correlation between adherence and outcome change
- Multiple regression: Baseline anxiety and meditation experience as moderators

### 9.4 Handling Missing Data
- Primary analysis: Complete case (participants with baseline + Week 4 data)
- Sensitivity analysis: Last observation carried forward (LOCF)
- Intention-to-treat: All randomized participants included

### 9.5 Adverse Events
Descriptive analysis of:
- Emergency Exit usage
- Dropout reasons
- Reports of increased distress

## 14. LIMITATIONS

- Small sample size (underpowered for subgroup analyses)
- No active control (can't separate specific vs. non-specific effects)
- Self-selected sample (may not generalize)
- Short follow-up (long-term effects unknown)
- Online delivery (adherence harder to ensure)

These limitations are acceptable for a pilot study and will inform future larger trials.
