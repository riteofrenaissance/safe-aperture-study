üéØ Purpose
This document serves three functions:
1.	Participant-Facing Questionnaire: Items as presented to participants during screening/baseline
2.	Data Codebook: Variable names, coding schemes, and allowed values
3.	Analysis Plan: How demographic data will be reported and analyzed
All demographic data is collected at baseline only (T0) and used for:
‚Ä¢	Sample description (Table 1 in publications)
‚Ä¢	Checking randomization balance between groups
‚Ä¢	Exploratory moderator analyses (age, education, baseline anxiety)
 
‚è∞ Data Collection Timeline
Assessment Point	Demographics	Notes
Screening	‚úÖ Collected	Before randomization
Baseline (T0)	‚úÖ Confirmed	Used for group assignment
Post-intervention (T1)	‚ùå Not collected	‚Äî
Follow-up (T2)	‚ùå Not collected	‚Äî
Rationale: Demographics are stable characteristics; repeated collection is unnecessary and increases participant burden.

üíæ Data Management
Data Storage
‚Ä¢	Raw data: Stored on secure REDCap server (HIPAA compliant)
‚Ä¢	De-identified data: GitHub repository (private until study completion)
‚Ä¢	OSF archive: De-identified data + codebook (public after publication)
Data Quality Checks
# Age validation
if (age < 18 | age > 99) ‚Üí flag for review

# Gender consistency
if (gender == 4 & is.na(gender_text)) ‚Üí prompt participant

# Missing data monitoring
if (sum(is.na(demographics)) > 3) ‚Üí flag participant record
De-identification Protocol
1.	Remove all free-text fields before public sharing
2.	Recode participant_id to random IDs
3.	Bin age into categories: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+
4.	Replace country with region: North America, Europe, Asia, Other
 
üìà Analysis Plan
1. Sample Description (Table 1)
Reported for:
‚Ä¢	Full sample (N=30)
‚Ä¢	Intervention group (n=15)
‚Ä¢	Control group (n=15)
Variables:
Age: M (SD), Range
Gender: n (%)
Education: n (%) per category
Employment: n (%) per category
Therapy history: n (%) Current vs Past vs None
Psychiatric medication: n (%)
Previous diagnosis (any): n (%)
Baseline anxiety (GAD-7): M (SD)
Format:
| Variable | Total (N=30) | Intervention (n=15) | Control (n=15) | p-value* |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| Age, M (SD) | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| Gender, n (%) | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| ... | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |

*p-values from chi-square tests (categorical) or t-tests (continuous)
 
2. Randomization Balance Checks
Statistical Tests:
‚Ä¢	Continuous variables (age, baseline GAD-7): Independent t-tests
‚Ä¢	Categorical variables (gender, education, etc.): Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test
‚Ä¢	Significance threshold: p < 0.05 (will be reported as potential baseline imbalance, not as exclusion criteria)
Expected Result: No significant differences between groups on demographic variables (confirms successful randomization).
 
3. Exploratory Moderator Analyses
Research Questions:
‚Ä¢	Does intervention effect vary by age? (median split or continuous)
‚Ä¢	Does baseline anxiety (GAD-7) moderate treatment response?
‚Ä¢	Does previous therapy history predict adherence?
Statistical Approach:
# Example: Age as moderator
lm(TAS_change ~ group * age_centered + baseline_TAS)

# Example: Baseline anxiety as moderator
lm(TAS_change ~ group * GAD7_baseline + baseline_TAS)
Reporting: All moderator analyses are exploratory and will be clearly labeled as such. No corrections for multiple comparisons (but effect sizes and CIs will be reported).
 
4. Attrition Analysis
Research Question: Do demographic characteristics predict dropout?
Variables Examined:
‚Ä¢	Age (younger ‚Üí higher dropout?)
‚Ä¢	Tech comfort (lower ‚Üí higher dropout?)
‚Ä¢	Baseline anxiety (higher ‚Üí higher dropout?)
‚Ä¢	Student status (busier ‚Üí higher dropout?)
Statistical Approach: Logistic regression:
glm(completed ~ age + tech_comfort + GAD7_baseline + student_status, 
    family = binomial)
 
üîí Ethical Considerations
Privacy Protection
1.	No identifiable information: Names, emails, IP addresses stored separately from research data
2.	Aggregate reporting: Cells with n < 3 will be suppressed in tables
3.	De-identification: All public data will be de-identified per protocol above
Informed Consent
Participants are informed:
"You will be asked to provide demographic information (age, gender, education, etc.) and answer questions about your mental health history. This information helps us describe our sample and check that our random assignment worked properly. All responses are optional, and your data will be reported in aggregate form only."
Sensitive Data
‚Ä¢	Mental health history questions include "Prefer not to answer" option
‚Ä¢	No diagnostic confirmation required (self-report only)
‚Ä¢	Free-text responses reviewed for identifiable information before data sharing
