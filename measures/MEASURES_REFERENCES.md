## 🎯 Study Context

This document provides complete bibliographic references for the three psychological measurement instruments used in the Safe Aperture Micro-Pilot Study—a pre-registered randomized controlled trial testing a 4-week online training intervention designed to increase tolerance of ambiguity.

**Research Question:** Can we train people to be more comfortable with uncertainty?

**Study Design:**
- **N = 30** participants (15 intervention, 15 control)
- **Design:** Randomized Controlled Trial
- **Duration:** 4 weeks intervention + 4 weeks follow-up
- **Primary Outcome:** Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (TAS)
- **Secondary Outcomes:** IUS-12, GAD-7

## 📊 Primary Outcome Measure

### TAS - Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (MSTAT-II)

**Why We Use It:**
The TAS serves as our **primary outcome measure** because it directly assesses the construct our intervention targets: tolerance of ambiguity. Changes in TAS scores from baseline to post-intervention (4 weeks) and follow-up (8 weeks) will indicate whether the Safe Aperture training successfully increases participants' comfort with uncertain and ambiguous situations.

Psychological Reports, 105(3), 975-988.
https://doi.org/10.2466/PR0.105.3.975-988
```

**Instrument Details:**
- **Items:** 13 items
- **Response Scale:** 5-point Likert (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree)
- **Scoring:** Mean of all items; higher scores = greater tolerance
- **Score Range:** 1.0 to 5.0
- **Internal Consistency:** α = 0.80
- **Test-Retest Reliability:** r = 0.78 (3 weeks)

**Assessment Schedule in Our Study:**
- ✅ Baseline (T0): Before randomization
- ✅ Post-intervention (T1): Week 4
- ✅ Follow-up (T2): Week 8

**Expected Effect:**
We hypothesize a **minimum detectable difference of 0.5 points** (d = 0.5) between intervention and control groups at T1.

## 📊 Secondary Outcome Measures

### 1. IUS-12 - Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (Short Form)

**Why We Use It:**
The IUS-12 measures a closely related but distinct construct: intolerance of uncertainty. We include it to explore whether training in ambiguity tolerance generalizes to reduced distress about uncertainty—a theoretically plausible but empirically testable hypothesis.

Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 21(1), 105-117.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.03.014
```

**Instrument Details:**
- **Items:** 12 items
- **Response Scale:** 5-point Likert (1 = Not at all characteristic to 5 = Entirely characteristic)
- **Scoring:** Sum of all items; higher scores = greater intolerance
- **Score Range:** 12 to 60
- **Internal Consistency:** α = 0.85-0.91
- **Test-Retest Reliability:** r = 0.74 (5 weeks)

**Subscales:**
- Prospective anxiety (7 items): Fear of future uncertainty
- Inhibitory anxiety (5 items): Paralysis in uncertain situations

**Assessment Schedule:**
- ✅ Baseline (T0)
- ✅ Post-intervention (T1)
- ✅ Follow-up (T2)

**Exploratory Hypothesis:**
We expect potential reductions in IUS-12 scores in the intervention group, particularly on the inhibitory anxiety subscale.

### 2. GAD-7 - Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale

**Why We Use It:**
The GAD-7 assesses general anxiety symptoms. We include it to:
1. Screen for baseline anxiety levels (inclusion: GAD-7 < 15)
2. Monitor participant safety during the intervention
3. Explore whether ambiguity training reduces anxiety symptoms

Archives of Internal Medicine, 166(10), 1092-1097.
https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092
```

**Instrument Details:**
- **Items:** 7 items
- **Time Frame:** Past 2 weeks
- **Response Scale:** 4-point Likert (0 = Not at all to 3 = Nearly every day)
- **Scoring:** Sum of all items
- **Score Range:** 0 to 21
- **Internal Consistency:** α = 0.92
- **Sensitivity/Specificity:** 89%/82% at cutoff ≥10

**Clinical Cutoffs:**
- 0-4: Minimal anxiety
- 5-9: Mild anxiety ✅ (eligible for study)
- 10-14: Moderate anxiety ✅ (eligible for study)
- 15-21: Severe anxiety ❌ (excluded; referred to resources)

**Assessment Schedule:**
- ✅ Screening: Pre-baseline (eligibility check)
- ✅ Baseline (T0)
- ✅ Post-intervention (T1)
- ✅ Follow-up (T2)
- ✅ Safety Check: Week 2 (intervention group only)

**Safety Protocol:**
Participants with GAD-7 ≥ 15 at any point are contacted and offered mental health resources.

## 📋 How These Measures Work Together

### Theoretical Model:
```
Safe Aperture Training
        ↓
[PRIMARY] ↑ Ambiguity Tolerance (TAS)
        ↓
[SECONDARY] ↓ Intolerance of Uncertainty (IUS-12)
        ↓
[EXPLORATORY] ↓ General Anxiety (GAD-7)
```

### Measurement Strategy:
- **TAS:** Confirms intervention directly affects target construct
- **IUS-12:** Tests theoretical generalization hypothesis
- **GAD-7:** Safety monitoring + exploratory clinical benefit

| **TAS** | Primary | 13 | 0.80 | d = 0.5 | T0, T1, T2 |
| **IUS-12** | Secondary | 12 | 0.85-0.91 | Exploratory | T0, T1, T2 |
| **GAD-7** | Safety/Exploratory | 7 | 0.92 | ≥15 = risk | Screen, T0, T1, T2, Week 2 |

## 📖 Citation in Our Study Protocol

### Methods Section (Example):

> **Measures**
> 
> *Primary Outcome:* Tolerance of ambiguity was assessed using McLain's (2009) Multiple Stimulus Types Ambiguity Tolerance Scale-II (MSTAT-II), a 13-item self-report measure with demonstrated reliability (α = 0.80) and validity across diverse populations.
> 
> *Secondary Outcomes:* Intolerance of uncertainty was measured with the 12-item short form (IUS-12; Carleton et al., 2007; α = 0.85-0.91). Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006; α = 0.92), which also served as a safety monitoring tool throughout the intervention.

IUS_Prosp_T0, IUS_Inhib_T0       # Subscales
GAD7_Screen, GAD7_T0, GAD7_T1, GAD7_T2, GAD7_Week2
```

### Scoring Scripts:
All scoring will be conducted using standardized R scripts (available in `/analysis/scoring/`), ensuring:
- Correct reverse-coding (if applicable)
- Handling of missing data (per instrument guidelines)
- Subscale calculations
- Automated range checks

## 🎯 Power Analysis Context

**Primary Outcome (TAS):**
- **Minimum detectable effect:** d = 0.5
- **Power:** 80%
- **Alpha:** 0.05 (two-tailed)
- **N required:** 26 (we recruited N=30 for 15% attrition buffer)

**Justification for d = 0.5:**
Previous mindfulness and cognitive interventions for related constructs show small-to-medium effects. Given our brief intervention (4 weeks), a conservative d = 0.5 represents a meaningful but achievable effect size.
