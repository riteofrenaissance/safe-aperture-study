# Safe Aperture Study - Research Proposal

**Pre-registered RCT | October 20, 2025**

---

## ðŸ“‹ Study Overview

**Research Question:**  
Does a 4-week graduated ambiguity tolerance training program increase tolerance of ambiguity and reduce anxiety compared to waitlist control?

**Design:** Randomized Controlled Trial  
**Sample:** N=30 (15 intervention, 15 control)  
**Duration:** 4 weeks active + 4 weeks follow-up  
**Status:** Pre-registered, seeking PI partnership

## ðŸŽ¯ Study Rationale & Objectives

### Problem
Ambiguity intolerance is a transdiagnostic factor underlying:
- Anxiety disorders
- Decision-making difficulties
- Avoidance behaviors
- Decreased quality of life

### Solution
Safe Aperture: A graduated, web-based exposure program targeting ambiguity tolerance directly.

### Primary Objectives
1. Evaluate efficacy of ambiguity tolerance training
2. Assess effects on intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety
3. Establish feasibility of digital delivery

## ðŸ”¬ Research Significance

This study addresses critical gaps:

âœ… **Evidence-based protocol** for uncertainty management  
âœ… **Accessible digital tool** for widespread dissemination  
âœ… **Foundation** for future clinical applications  
âœ… **Contribution** to anxiety and decision-making research

**Context:** Increasing prevalence of uncertainty-related distress in modern society makes this intervention particularly timely.

## ðŸ“š Research Background

### Current Literature

**Key Findings:**
- Ambiguity intolerance is transdiagnostic in anxiety disorders
- Limited evidence-based interventions target uncertainty directly
- Digital mental health tools show promise for accessible care
- Graduated exposure effectively reduces avoidance

**Our Contribution:**
This study builds on existing work while addressing significant gaps in digital ambiguity tolerance training.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### Design
Pre-registered randomized controlled trial

### Participants
- **N = 30** total
- **Inclusion:** Adults 18-65, fluent in [language], daily internet
- **Exclusion:** Active suicidal ideation, psychosis history

### Intervention
**Experimental Group (n=15):**
- Week 1-2: Level 1 (Everyday ambiguity, 10 min/day)
- Week 3: Level 2 (Interpersonal ambiguity, 15 min/day)
- Week 4: Level 3 (Conceptual ambiguity, 20 min/day)

**Control Group (n=15):**
- Waitlist (offered intervention after study)

### Measures
- **Primary:** Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (TAS)
- **Secondary:** IUS-12, GAD-7
- **Timepoints:** Baseline, Week 4, Week 8

### Analysis
- Mixed-effects modeling
- Intention-to-treat analysis
- Effect size estimation (Cohen's d)
