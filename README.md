## Overview

Randomized controlled pilot study (N=30) testing the efficacy of **Safe Aperture**, a graduated ambiguity tolerance training program.

**Timeline:** December 2025 - February 2026  
**Funding:** Self-funded ($5,000)  
**Status:** Pre-registered, IRB submission in progress

---

## Research Question

Does a 4-week Safe Aperture training program increase ambiguity tolerance compared to waitlist control?

---

## Design

- **Type:** Randomized controlled pilot
- **Sample:** N=30 adults (18-65 years)
- **Groups:** 
  - Intervention (n=15): Safe Aperture training (Levels 1-3)
  - Waitlist Control (n=15): No intervention during active period
- **Duration:** 4 weeks active + 4 weeks follow-up
- **Delivery:** Web-based via [Safe Aperture platform](https://riteofrenaissance.github.io/riteofrenaissance/safe_aperture_simulation.html)

---

## Measures

### Primary Outcome
- **Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (TAS)** - McLain (2009)
  - Timepoints: Baseline, Week 4, Week 8

### Secondary Outcomes
- **Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12)** - Carleton et al. (2007)
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)** - Spitzer et al. (2006)

## Intervention: Safe Aperture

Safe Aperture is a graduated training program using structured exposure to ambiguous stimuli.

**Structure:**
- **Level 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Everyday ambiguity (10 min/day)
- **Level 2 (Week 3):** Interpersonal ambiguity (15 min/day)  
- **Level 3 (Week 4):** Conceptual ambiguity (20 min/day)

**Platform:** [https://riteofrenaissance.github.io/riteofrenaissance/safe_aperture_simulation.html](https://riteofrenaissance.github.io/riteofrenaissance/safe_aperture_simulation.html)

**Safety Features:**
- Emergency Exit button
- Weekly check-ins
- Distress monitoring protocol
