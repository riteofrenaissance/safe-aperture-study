🎯 Research Question

Does a 4-week graduated Safe Aperture training program increase tolerance of ambiguity compared to waitlist control?

📖 Background

Rationale

Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor for:

· Generalized anxiety disorder
· Depression
· Poor decision-making under ambiguity
· Avoidance behaviors

Existing interventions (CBT, mindfulness) address IU indirectly. Safe Aperture proposes a direct, graduated exposure approach specifically targeting ambiguity tolerance.

Theoretical Foundation

· Exposure therapy principles: Repeated, graduated exposure reduces anxiety
· Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): Observation without interpretation
· Mindfulness: Present-moment awareness without judgment

Innovation

Unlike general mindfulness training, Safe Aperture:
✅Targets ambiguity specifically
✅ Uses structured progression
✅ Includes built-in safety protocols
✅ Balances challenge with support

🧪 Study Design

Participants

Inclusion:

· Age 18-65 years
· Fluent in study language
· Daily internet access
· Willing to commit 10-20 min/day for 4 weeks

Exclusion:

· Active suicidal ideation
· History of psychotic disorder
· Severe untreated depression (PHQ-9 > 20)
· Current participation in other psychological intervention

Randomization

· Method: Simple 1:1 randomization via random number generator
· Timing: After baseline assessment completion
· Stratification: None (pilot study)

Intervention

Experimental Group: Safe Aperture Training

Level Duration Focus Time/Day
Level 1 Weeks 1-2 Everyday ambiguity 10 min
Level 2 Week 3 Interpersonal ambiguity 15 min
Level 3 Week 4 Conceptual ambiguity 20 min

Delivery: Web-based platform
Control Group: Waitlist (no intervention during active period; offered training after Week 8)

📊 Measures

Primary Outcome

Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (TAS) - McLain (2009)

· 13 items, 5-point Likert scale
· Higher scores = greater tolerance
· Timepoints: Baseline, Week 4 (post), Week 8 (follow-up)

Secondary Outcomes

Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale - Short Form (IUS-12)

· Carleton et al. (2007)
· 12 items, 5-point Likert
· Higher = greater intolerance

Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)

· Spitzer et al. (2006)
· 7 items, 4-point scale
· Range 0-21; ≥10 = moderate anxiety

Process Measures

· Adherence: % of exercises completed
· Satisfaction: 5-item post-intervention questionnaire
· Safety: Adverse events (weekly monitoring)

🔬 Hypotheses (Pre-registered)

H1 (Primary)

Intervention group will show significantly greater increase in TAS scores (Baseline → Week 4) compared to control.

Analysis: Independent samples t-test on change scores
Expected effect: Cohen's d ≥ 0.5 (medium)

H2 (Persistence)

Intervention effects will partially persist at Week 8 follow-up (though possibly attenuated).

H3 (Secondary outcomes)

Improvements in TAS will be paralleled by:

· Decreased IUS-12 scores (lower intolerance)
· Decreased GAD-7 scores (lower anxiety)

H4 (Exploratory - Moderators)

Baseline anxiety will moderate intervention effects:

· Moderate anxiety → largest gains
· High anxiety → smaller gains (ceiling effect)
